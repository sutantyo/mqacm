I think the term "survival of the fittest" is commonly percepted in a somewhat
wrong way. As the description of question 3 of this week's discussion topics
implies it does not necessarily apply only to the individual organism. Rather
there are abundant examples of collectivism in nature of which I want to give
just two examples:

1) Colonies of state-building insects, e.g. ants, bees, wasps:
These kind of species have a lot of highly specialized invidual members which
perform tasks within the division of labour which are clearly not to their
personal benefit but to that of the community as a whole. That behaviour is
called "eusocial". Because typically only one of the many members actually
reproduces (the "queen") there is obviously no way that the workers can give
their genes to the next generation themselves. However they perform important
tasks in nest building, food aquisition, care for the queen's offspring,
defence against intruders and so on which benefit the queen's offspring and
in that way also their own genes which are shared with the queen's. [1] [2]

2) Humans:
Humans have developed a number of traits which enable them to survive as a
group much better than they would do without these traits. The most important
one in my view is language, i.e. the ability to communicate in abstract terms.
This enabled Homo Sapiens to build increasingly sophisticated societies with
ever-increasing technological achievements which in turn made them populate
basically the entire world (it's surface, at least) in the last 50.000 to
100.000 years on the expense of other Homo species and lot's of non-Homo
species as well. To achieve this, a high level of cooperation is needed with
individual members often showing altruistic behaviour not only in supporting
their next of kin but also strangers, i.e. society as a whole. This works
even when some individuals clearly act in selfish ways as long as they are
in a relatively small minority. So in evolutionary terms Homo Sapiens had
some very successful tens of thousands of years lately. Of course, the moral
implications of making a lot of other species getting distinct in the process
are an altogether different thing which evolution doesn't stress itself with.
